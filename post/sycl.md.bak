Back in 2009 when I began doing real work with GPGPUs and [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA)
in the context of large scale HPC simulations, the developer experience was *dreadful*.
Sure, for the right algorithm and after lots of blood and tears, performances usually
turned out excellent. But before production, comes the poor developer. Debugging CUDA
kernels was a nightmare: whenever I had to track down a bug I had to fire up a dedicated
gaming rig (bought just for that purpose) because debuggers needed *two identical GPUs to
work* (when they actually worked, and that happened only if you spelled your prayers right
the night before). Compilers segfaulted all the time.
Generated [PTX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Thread_Execution)
assembly was often *incorrect* (just imagine debugging *correct* C++ code that has been
wrongly translated by your faulty compiler, on a weird hardware you can't really observe,
with poor tooling support).

On top of that depressing experience, one of the main CUDA goals was clearly to be an
*efficient vendor lock-in tool*. Once you invested effort and money on CUDA, you're stuck
with NVIDIA hardware.

Luckily, during the last ten years the GPGPU tooling ecosystem improved *a lot*. Compilers
have become stable, debuggers are now usable, we even have
[PTX backends](https://llvm.org/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.html)
in toolchains other than `nvcc`, a plethora of alternative approaches emerged and keep
pushing to gain market (I would say that [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) is
the most notable one, among others).

In late 2018, almost ten years after my first encounter with GPGPUs, I came across this
*new* (to me) thing called [SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/).
The official description says:

> SYCL (pronounced *sickle*) is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that
> builds on the underlying concepts, portability and efficiency of [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/)
> that enables code for **heterogeneous processors** to be written in a **single-source**
> style using **completely standard C++**. SYCL single-source programming enables the host
> and kernel code for an application to be contained in the same source file, in a
> **type-safe** way and with the simplicity of a **cross-platform asynchronous task
> graph**.

Sounds interesting, isn't it?

At that time I couldn't exactly figure out its actual adoption in the wild, was it
widespread in other markets or simply a niche thing? It was maybe *the next big thing*
that no one wanted to actually use in the real world?

And then this happened:

{{< tweet 1141736086726750209 >}}

Intel announced to the world that their common programming model intended to target the
whole heterogeneous system, from GPUs to FPGAs to regular x86 CPUs, is going to be based
on SYCL. It looks like they are actively investing an interesting amount of effort on it
and they're doing a lot of work to
[integrate into upstream LLVM](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2019-January/060811.html)
their own SYCL implementation.

At this point, all the experiments and prototypes I was doing during my daily job assumed
a totally different perspective.

## What does SYCL look like?

For those familiar with OpenCL (and CUDA to some extent), SYCL is built on the same
concepts: it borrows the same device and execution models straight from OpenCL, which in
turn is extremely similar to CUDA. Let's just have a look at a simple kernel that performs
an element wise sum between containers:

```cpp
// Kernel type tag
// Be sure to define it in an externally accessible
// namespace (e.g.: no anonymous)
template <typename>
struct AddKernel {};

template<typename ContiguousContainer>
void add(const ContiguousContainer& a, const ContiguousContainer& b,
         ContiguousContainer& result) {
    using std::data,
          std::size;
    using value_type = std::remove_cv_t<std::remove_reference_t<decltype(*data(c))>>;
    using kernel_tag = AddKernel<value_type>;

    // Queue's destructor will wait for all pending operations to complete
    cl::sycl::queue queue;

    // Create buffers (views on a, b and result contiguous storage)
    cl::sycl::buffer<value_type> A{data(a), size(result)};
    cl::sycl::buffer<value_type> B{data(b), size(result)};
    cl::sycl::buffer<value_type> R{data(result), size(result)};

    // The command group describes all setup operations needed
    // to execute the kernel on the selected device
    queue.submit([&](cl::sycl::handler& cgh) {
        // Get proper accessors to existing buffers by specifying
        // read/write intents
        // (note that A, B and R are captured by reference)
        auto ka = A.get_access<cl::sycl::access::mode::read>(cgh);
        auto kb = B.get_access<cl::sycl::access::mode::read>(cgh);
        auto kr = R.get_access<cl::sycl::access::mode::write>(cgh);

        // Enqueue parallel kernel
        cgh.parallel_for<kernel_tag>(
            cl::sycl::range<1>{size(result)},  // 1st parameter: the kernel grid
            [=](cl::sycl::id<1> idx) {         // 2nd parameter: the actual kernel
                // We are in the kernel body:
                // this is the only code that gets compiled for device(s).
                kr[idx] = ka[idx] + kb[idx];
            }
        );
    });
    // At this point our kernel has been asynchronously submitted
    // for execution

    // End of current scope: before actually returning, the queue destructor
    // will block until all operations (copies and kernel executions)
    // are completed. We are sure that when the function returns all the
    // computed values have been transferred into 'result' and are available
    // host-side.
}
```

Let's quickly see at a very high level the essential building blocks needed
by a SYCL program:

1. tell SYCL where the **host-side input and output memory** you're going
        to use for your kernels is by constructing **buffers**;
2. construct a **command queue**, an object of type `cl::sycl::queue` that is
       going to be your steering wheel for all the execution devices that support
       kernel execution;
3. **submit** a unit of work in the form of a **callable object** (a lambda
       expression in this case, but everything that satisfies the
       [`Callable` concept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Callable)
       will do the job[^callable]) via `cl::sycl::queue::submit()`.

[^callable]: ...everything that satisfies the
    [`Callable` concept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Callable)
    *and* accepts an argument of type `cl::sycl::handler&`. The *handler* is
    your source of information about the execution context you're in
    (e.g.: on which device you've been actually scheduled).

At this point, *we're done*: the callable object you just submitted is going to
be executed on *a device* (more on this later). Well, we still need to see what
is needed to define the proper *unit of work* we just submitted to the
*command queue*:

1. define our **data dependencies**: this is achieved by declaring
        **accessors**, objects that tell SYCL about our intents on the
        *buffers* we previously defined (`cl::sycl::access::mode::read`
        for read-only,`cl::sycl::access::mode::write` for write-only);
2. **invoke the actual kernel** on the selected device via
        `cl::sycl::handler::parallel_for<>()` template method. Just like we saw
        before for the submission to the command queue, the kernel is just an
        object of [`Callable` type](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Callable)
        (more on the arguments later).

***Now we are really done***.

From this trivial example we can make some interesting observations about the SYCL
programming model:

#### Modern APIs

Queues are drained, copies are finalized, destructors do their job: all SYCL objects are
of [RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization) types, so
we can call it *modern* (I would call it *sane*) with respect to types design.

#### Just standard C++11

Luckily enough, no weird keyword or syntax is involved, just standard C++11 code [^cxxstd].
Note that in the previous example all invocable objects are passed as regular lambdas.

[^cxxstd]: the SYCL specification is actually based on C++11 but this restriction applies only
    to the body of the kernel lambda, e.g. the only code that is going to be actually
    compiled by device backends. In the example I used some C++17 library stuff
    ([`std::data()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/data) for instance),
    and it is ok as long as the host frontend supports it.

#### Single source

*Host* and *device* code live in the same source file. It is a SYCL implementation's
responsibility to split the C++ source file and forward each chunk of parsed code to the
right compilation backend (similarly to what `nvcc` does and as opposed to what OpenCL
APIs require) [^compilation].

[^compilation]: while totally invisible to the user, the standard specification
    allows two different workflows for compilation:
  
    * *separate compilation*: a frontend driver splits the C++ source and calls
        different device compilers under the hood before linking everything together
        in a fat binary;
    * *single source compilation*: the actual compiler frontend parses the input
        translation unit just once (remember that we are dealing just with standard
        C++11 code) and then forwards the lowered representation to all the device
        backends involved.
        For example, [hipSYCL](https://github.com/illuhad/hipSYCL) used to rely on
        *separate compilation* using via a
        [python script](https://github.com/illuhad/hipSYCL/blob/master/bin/syclcc)
        to carry out all the orchestration but they recently moved to the
        *single source compilation* technique leveraging the
        [clang plugin interface](https://github.com/illuhad/hipSYCL/blob/master/bin/syclcc-clang).

#### Data transfers are implicit

Unlike CUDA and OpenCL where explicit copies are required by the model, here we just
declare our read/write intent over `cl::sycl::buffer` and the SYCL runtime
deduces[^explicit-copy] which buffers have to be transferred to and from host 
containers [^contiguous-container].

[^explicit-copy]: [Jeff Hammond](https://jeffhammond.github.io/) pointed out
    that while asynchronous is the default, we can actually force
    explicit data transfers by calling the `cl::sycl::handler::copy()` method
    like he did
    [here](https://github.com/ParRes/Kernels/blob/5394bed370b6b50e73062231f9d47ed9bfc31197/Cxx11/nstream-explicit-sycl.cc#L141).

[^contiguous-container]: since we are constructing *non-owning views* (`cl::sycl::buffer<T>`
    acts exactly like a [`std::span<T>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/span)
    in this regard) over contiguous chunks of memory that have to be transferred across
    different address spaces, make sure that the
    [`ContiguousContainer` concept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ContiguousContainer)
    is satisfied: while we wait for C++20 to bring proper concepts in, we can
    reasonably ensure the *contiguous sequence* (e.g.: *contiguous storage*)
    property just like
    [`GSL` does for `gsl::span<T>`](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL/blob/1212beae777dba02c230ece8c0c0ec12790047ea/include/gsl/span#L419-L426)).

This design principle affects also the execution order of kernels: SYCL command queues are
required to be asyncronous and, while the actual execution order is unspecified, *data
dependencies* across kernels are guaranteed to be satisfied by the runtime.

```cpp
using cl::sycl::access::mode::read,
      cl::sycl::access::mode::write,
      cl::sycl::access::mode::read_write;

cl::sycl::buffer<T> A{/*...*/};
cl::sycl::buffer<T> B{/*...*/};
cl::sycl::buffer<T> C{/*...*/};

cl::sycl::queue queue;

// Kernel 1
queue.submit([&](cl::sycl::handler& cgh) {
    auto in  = A.get_access<read>(cgh);
    auto out = B.get_access<write>(cgh);
    //...
}

// Kernel 2
queue.submit([&](cl::sycl::handler& cgh) {
    auto in  = A.get_access<read>(cgh);
    auto out = C.get_access<write>(cgh);
    //...
}

// Kernel 3
queue.submit([&](cl::sycl::handler& cgh) {
    auto in    = B.get_access<read>(cgh);
    auto inout = C.get_access<read_write>(cgh);
    //...
}
```

What the runtime does here is that it builds the *dependency graph* of our kernels based
on the *data dependencies* we implicitly declared among them by retrieving *accessors*. In
this case the runtime deduces the following dependency
[DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (arrow is a *depends on*
relationship):

![deps](/img/sycl-kernel-dependencies.png)

Given this situation, the runtime *could* execute `Kernel 1` and `Kernel 2` concurrently
while the data needed by `Kernel 3` to carry out its work ensures that it is going to be
executed only after the completion of its dependencies.

Even in a trivial example like this where we submit a bunch of kernels, we can achieve
maximum overlapping between non-dependent data flows on the DAG implicitly deduced from
our *buffer accessors*. This looks extremely convenient compared to what happens in other
paradigms where, in real world applications, a large amount of effort must be spent to
achieve maximum overlapping between data transfers and kernel executions.

#### Kernels are launched over a grid

The *implicit iteration space* over which kernels are executed has shape and extent,
just like a CUDA kernel grid. Let's have a look at the `parallel_for` call
(ignore `kernel_tag`[^kernel-tag] for now):

```cpp
    // Enqueue parallel kernel
    cgh.parallel_for<kernel_tag>(
        cl::sycl::range<1>{size(result)},  // 1st parameter: the kernel grid
    // ...
```

With the first parameter we are saying that the kernel grid will have
**one dimension** (the non-type template parameter) with extent
`== size(result)`. In the same way as other paradigms work, with the
`cl::sycl::range<1>{n}` parameter we are launching a 1-dimensional vector
of execution units, one for each of the `n` output elements.

[^kernel-tag]: the `parallel_for` template is instantiated on an (empty) type,
    in this case called `class AddKernel`. This *tag* is used only to give the
    anonymous callable object generated by the lambda expression a unique,
    user-defined name on which (possibly) different compilers can agree on.
    Look at it as workaround to de-anonymize compiler-generated callable
    objects (or a way to have `extern` lambdas).
    Please note that the tag itself is templatized on the `value_type`
    of containers: each kernel template instantiation *must be different*, in
    other words **be aware that kernels are just regular functions and so
    they must abide by [ODR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Definition_Rule)!**

The SYCL standard brings so much at the stake, interesting bits like *device selectors*
(customizable objects that decide on which actual device a kernel will be executed), error
handling and reporting, n-dimensional kernel grids, device allocators, device atomics and
*a lot more*, enough to write entire books on the subject. Just stop here for now, you get
the general idea.

## Challenges

As clearly [pointed out by Justin Lebar](https://youtu.be/KHa-OSrZPGo) (one of the authors
of the clang's PTX backend): *CUDA Is a Low Level Language*. And that is perfectly
understandable: the accelerated portion of any application is going to be the hottest one,
that kind of hotspot that is usually carefully optimized, likely by hand, iteratively,
with the help of micro-benchmarks and packed with tricks and hacks that privilege
performance over clarity or maintenance and are obviously tightly related to the actual
hardware it targets. While SYCL claims to be *portable* and *cross platform*, just look at
the amount of extensions are being introduced to support FPGA targets
(`cl::sycl::vendor::xilinx::dataflow` for example,
[here](https://github.com/triSYCL/triSYCL/blob/6e5565f89338a6a74d7283085da980f0c400c57e/tests/pipeline/single_task_vector_add_drt_dataflow_func_local_pipeline.cpp)
in `triSYCL`): this is completely normal since FPGAs are weird beasts, radically different
from regular GPGPU architectures and so, in hot, accelerated code this profound difference
stands out clearly.

I think this is going to be a recurring pattern in real world, SYCL-accelerated code
bases: a bunch of different SYCL kernels, each one hand-optimized for a class of
architectures, a single architecture or even a specific product just like happens in CUDA
or OpenCL nowadays. In other words, I would say that SYCL ~~**has not performance
portability among its design goals**~~.

Despite this inevitable shortcoming, SYCL still brings a lot of advantages, for example:

* **convenience and developer _sanity_**: it is just standard C++ code, no
  language extensions, no weird toolchains, tooling ecosystem readily available;
* **host CPU backends are available from day one**: they enable the applications to leverage
  *both* the host CPU and discrete accelerators and, maybe important alike, they provide
  easy debugging, observability and seamless deployment (e.g. you don't have to buy some
  beefy gaming laptop just to be able to develop your stuff);
* **a terse, modern and expressive API**, miles ahead of the sheer verbosity of OpenCL;
* **no vendor-lock in**: your code can be run almost everywhere, from CPU-only and
  accelerated servers to Android phones. Even if NVIDIA could try to gatekeep
  [SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/) support on their own platform,
  when in presence of CUDA hardware the compiler could just sidestep SPIR-V generation and
  go directly for the PTX backend to natively compile SYCL kernels for NVIDIA hardware 😎 [^gpucc].

[^gpucc]: in the original [`gpucc` paper](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45226),
    Google claims that their open source PTX backend (now
    [merged in upstream LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.html))
    is either on par or outperforms `nvcc` for all the workloads they took
    into account.

Moreover, several open and closed source implementations are already available,
each one with its goals and strenghts:

* [triSYCL](https://github.com/triSYCL/triSYCL), the reference implementation;
* [hipSYCL](https://github.com/illuhad/hipSYCL), an alternative open source 
    implementation originally targeted at [AMD ROCm](https://rocm.github.io/);
* [ComputeCpp](https://www.codeplay.com/products/computesuite/computecpp), a commercial
    (the community edition is available free of charge), closed source implementation by
    [Codeplay](https://www.codeplay.com/);
* builtin [clang](https://github.com/intel/llvm/tree/sycl) support for SYCL, actively
    developed by Intel and aimed at being reintegrated in upstream LLVM.

To summarize the ecosystem, I will borrow this chart directly from the
[hipSYCL](https://github.com/illuhad/hipSYCL) documentation:

![targets](/img/sycl-targets.png)

Wrapping up, I personally think that the first, realistic, valuable goal that SYCL can
achieve is to estabilish both **a standard platform and a common vocabulary for
heterogeneous systems programming** on which people coming from different industries and
backgrounds can build communities, share code, tooling, build systems and, more
importantly, **break out from vendor lock-ins**.

Of course, the most important question right now is:

*Will it succeed?*
