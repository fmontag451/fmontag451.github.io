      <description>During the last meetup of the Italian C++ Community in Modena, Italy I had the chance to give a talk about profiling C++ code. The whole game boils down to understanding what&amp;rsquo;s going on when you have to cope with very smart optimizing compilers, NUMA architectures and speculative, superscalar CPUs: in this quest for knowledge we are lucky enough to have some extremely useful tools like the holy perf and micro benchmarks, using the excellent Google Benchmark for instance.</description>

      <title>Aliasing Explained (Part 1)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since my job involves a lot of HPC stuff and performance-obsessed code, one of
the first topics I had to dive into was &lt;strong&gt;aliasing in the C standard&lt;/strong&gt;. I
found out that it is a subtle topic, quite obscure and very often
overlooked even by the most experienced programmers. This post is an attempt
to clarify the concept of &lt;em&gt;aliasing&lt;/em&gt;, why should we care, how it impacts
the code generated by the compiler and how can we master it with no hassle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
