      <title>Salvaging 10 years of Trac while moving to GitLab: tooling for a better life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago in my team at work we began considering a complete makeover of our devops
infrastructure. The platform in use was based on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://trac.edgewall.org/&#34;&gt;Trac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a tool that ten
years ago proved itself packed with features, looked great and came in the form of an
open, clear and easily extensible Python code base. Almost &lt;strong&gt;a mandatory choice back
then&lt;/strong&gt;. It served us &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well (thanks Trac folks!), even when it had to run on
underpowered hardware, without maintenance and under heavy loads. Despite its stability
and practicality, the need for a proper, &lt;em&gt;modern&lt;/em&gt; devops platform seamlessly supporting
continuous integration and deployment pipelines, as well as code review, suddenly came
out. &lt;strong&gt;The choice went for &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a solution that would have given us
the same degree of freedom (free community edition, open source, easily manageable on
premise) along all the shiny new features we were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, &lt;strong&gt;the issue of how to migrate all of the content came out&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
